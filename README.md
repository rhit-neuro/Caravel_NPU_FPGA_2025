# Caravel FPGA 2025
See [this link](https://github.com/efabless/Caravel_on_FPGA) to original repo by Efabless.


## Adding VexRiscv Core:
- Generated compatible VexRiscv core using [this SpinalHDL](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv) repo. The file used is found [here](SpinalHDL_Scala_files/VexRiscvCachedWishboneForSim.scala) and was run from [this folder](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv/tree/master/src/main/scala/vexriscv/demo) using the SinalHDL instructions.
- The generated verilog VexRiscv core was imported into a Vivado project containing all of the verilog from [this folder](CARAVEL/CARAVEL.srcs/sources_1/imports/src).
## Configuring the original repo for Nexys A7:
- We did not have a Cmod Artix 7-35T FPGA or QSPI SST26VF080A Flash module, so we used the Nexys A7-100T Digilent board as it has an integrated QSPI flash connected directly to FPGA fabric.
- The Cmod Artix 7-35T has a 12MHz oscillator but our Nexys A7-100T has a 100MHz oscillator, so we used Vivado Clock wizard to generate a clk_fix part to convert clocks as seen [here](CARAVEL/CARAVEL.srcs/sources_1/imports/src/caravel.v).
- The clock pin to the Nexys QSPI flash is not accessable using the I/O planner and instead must be set with the STARTUPE2 primative. Our configuration of STARTUPE2 is found [here](CARAVEL/CARAVEL.srcs/sources_1/imports/src/caravel.v).
- Since we are using a different FPGA, we had to make our own configuration file. Our configuration file is found [here](CARAVEL/CARAVEL.srcs/constrs_1/new/CARVEL.xdc).
- We used the Raspberry Pi Pico method of flashing the QSPI flash as described by the original repo. However, we had to alter some of the code for compatability with our flash. The updated code is found [here](Micropython_scripts/flash).
## Loading Caravel and Flashing the QSPI Flash
The steps are similar to those described in the original repo:
- We did not make our own program, we used the hex file from the original repo found [here](hex_file/debug_gpio.hex) and [here](Micropython_scripts/debug_gpio.hex).
- We used Vivado to program the FPGA with Caravel as described by the original repo.
- Our hardware connections are changed to the following:
	- No need to connect an external flash
	- FPGA PMOD JC1 (mprj_io[1]/SDO) will be connected to pin 6 in Raspberry pi pico (MISO/ SPIO RX)
	- FPGA PMOD JC2 (mprj_io[2]/SDI) will be connected to pin 5 in Raspberry pi pico (MOSI/ SPIO TX)
	- FPGA PMOD JC3 (mprj_io[3]/CSB) will be connected to pin 7 in Raspberry pi pico (SPIO CSn)
	- FPGA PMOD JC4 (mprj_io[4]/SCK) will be connected to pin 4 in Raspberry pi pico (SPIO SCK)
- We followed the original repo instructions for setting up the Raspberry Pi Pico.
## Original Repo Step 2: Caravel implementation on FPGA
- At this point Caravel should be flashing LED0 on the Nexys FPGA, proving that Caravel is running.
- We did not verify that step 2 works, this is left for future groups. 
Test


# Code Compilation for Caravel:

The following section will have 2 parts. 
1.  The first part will go over the main process flow for converting a simple C program to a hexadecimal file to execute on Caravel.
2. The second part will explain the process steps as we understand and what changes were made from the [original caravel_mgmt_soc_litex](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_mgmt_soc_litex) repository.


>[!IMPORTANT]
>The gnu-tool chain for the RISC-V cross compiler must be installed first before following any steps below. Navigate to the [risv-gnu-toolchain repository](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain) and follow the installation steps. The installation takes about 2.5hrs and must be done in a **linux environment**.It has been confirmed to work on `wsl` for `Ubuntu 24.04`.
<br> For compiler installation default installation paths with the `./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv --with-arch=rv32gc --with-abi=ilp32d` configuration setting were used.


## 1. Process Flow Steps: 
Before starting ensure the following exports are present in the `~/.bashrc` file:
```bash
export DESIGNS='/home/<user>/<ROOT_FOLDER>'
export TOOLS='/opt/riscv'
```
(here the `ROOT_FOLDER` is the folder in which the following repository is cloned)

Then clone the repository using: 
```
git clone https://github.com/rhit-neuro/Caravel_FPGA_2025.git
```

Ensure you are in the correct branch for the cloned repository, if not you can change the branch by
```
git checkout <branch name>
```

>[!NOTE]
>All the following will assume default directory structure. If the paths are changed the commands will have to be changed accordingly. 


Make sure to navigate to the **caravel_mgmt_soc_litex** folder from the root folder. Then navigate to the **gpio_mgmt** folder.

```
cd caravel_mgmt_soc_litex
cd verilog/dv/tests-caravel/gpio_mgmt
```

Here the **gpio_mgmt.c** file can then be edited to write the desired C program. Currently it contains a working iteration of loading values directly into the LUT and asking it to calculated 4 values. <br>
Note - *This iteration requires re-loading data into the LUT after each calculation*

Once the C code is modified run the `make hex` command in the **gpio_mgmt** folder and a `.hex` file with the same name should be generated.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> The generated hex file for some reason has 2 more @0000xxxxx addresses instead of just the @00000000 address. This causes **errors** if not fixed.
To fix this simply remove all the hex code including and below those addresses. 

Below is an example of correct hex file:
```
@00000000
6F 00 00 0B 13 00 00 00 13 00 00 00 13 00 00 00
13 00 00 00 13 00 00 00 13 00 00 00 13 00 00 00
23 2E 11 FE 23 2C 51 FE 23 2A 61 FE 23 28 71 FE
.
.
.
13 07 10 00 23 A0 E7 00 EF F0 0F A5 B7 07 00 30
93 85 C7 60 37 05 C0 40 EF F0 5F DF B7 07 00 30
93 85 07 60 B7 27 9A BE 13 85 17 68 EF F0 1F DE
B7 07 00 30 93 85 47 60 37 05 A0 40 EF F0 1F DD
B7 07 00 30 93 85 87 60 B7 77 37 C1 13 85 17 3A
EF F0 DF DB 6F F0 9F FB
```

And this is the generated problematic hex file:
```
@00000000
6F 00 00 0B 13 00 00 00 13 00 00 00 13 00 00 00

## 2. Explanation of changes and process flow

Code generation is done using a modified version of the [caravel_mgmt_soc_litex](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_mgmt_soc_litex) repository. 

We had to modify Makefiles and ensure the correct exports in the `~/.bashrc` (which are shown in [Process Flow section](#1-process-flow-steps)) file to get code generation working for us. <br> In this section we will present the changes we made and some rationale to why they were made.

### Makefiles

The following Makefiles were changed and why they were changed:
- [`cpu.makefile`](./caravel_mgmt_soc_litex/verilog/dv/make/cpu.makefile): Contains variable initializations for FIRMWARE source files and Caravel's verilog (including our VexRiscV core)
- [`env.makefile`](./caravel_mgmt_soc_litex/verilog/dv/make/env.makefile): Contains exports for Caravel's verilog path, core verilog path, userproject verilog path and lastly the cross compiler paths (installed above)
- [`sim.makefile`](./caravel_mgmt_soc_litex/verilog/dv/make/sim.makefile): Main Makefile to compile the hex file for the code. We had to change some makefile commands and comment out waveform simulation generation code in makefile
- [`var.makefile`](./caravel_mgmt_soc_litex/verilog/dv/make/var.makefile): Contains variable definitions used in the `sim.makefile` for compiler flags to compile the C code (eventually turned into `hex` files). The flags involve defining CPU (vexriscv for us) type, family, endianness and other cross compiler specific settings

> [!TIP]
> Currently all code is compiled in the [gpio_mgmt](./caravel_mgmt_soc_litex/verilog/dv/tests-caravel/gpio_mgmt/) folder which is the default that the code in [Caravel_on_FPGA](https://github.com/efabless/Caravel_on_FPGA) uses to compile C code to run on caravel. However, to create your own folder structure for the C project you'd have to make the appropriate changes in the `sim.makefile` and the [local Makefile](./caravel_mgmt_soc_litex/verilog/dv/tests-caravel/gpio_mgmt/Makefile) in the gpio_mgmt folder.
