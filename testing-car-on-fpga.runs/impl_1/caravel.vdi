WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 chip_core/soc/core/RAM128/RAM_reg has an input control pin chip_core/soc/core/RAM128/RAM_reg/ADDRARDADDR[6] (net: chip_core/soc/core/RAM128/RAM_reg_8) which is driven by a register (chip_core/soc/core/VexRiscv/memory_to_writeBack_IS_DBUS_SHARING_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
